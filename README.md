# PHP Tech exercise with GraphQL and Schemas

## Scenario
We need to store some details for our users and abstract it as much as possible from the DB. To achieve this, we recommend using GraphQL schema language files, not only for the GraphQL definition but also for the DB structure so we have a 1 to 1 representation of the data we are handling.

## Requirements

- Write a GraphQL API that allows you to add/edit user data.
- Retrieve a list of the users with the desired fields.
- Use Laravel or Symfony 4 + GraphQL.
- Use the built in PHP server for the local environment.
- Use a local storage technique (CSV, SQLite, â€¦) to save the data.

## Valued aspects
We will evaluate different aspects of the application. Such as
- The architecture chosen to solve the problem.
- Usage of GraphQL Inputs for the Muttations.
- Commit history and organisation.
- Clean and organised code.

Don't overcomplicate yourself. Maybe a simpler approach, is more elegant and easier to understand and read. The aspects that say _or not_ are only there to hint you where you can move towards.
